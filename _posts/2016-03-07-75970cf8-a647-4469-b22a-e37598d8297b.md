### **Physical Investor / Entrepreneur**

Taking an active role in investing for the future is to me a critical part of anyone's life. Investing to me means more than just stocks and bonds stashed away in a 401K. Taking a physical approach to investing I hold many unique assets above and beyond stocks and bonds.

For more information regarding my physical investments in rental real-estate, solar electricity, and tropical hard woods please visit my investment website

Due to, yet beyond my personal investments I have found the need to create businesses and formal structures.  Some of these are simply extensions of the investments that I have made the like the website above. Others derive from my new found interest in management and project management practices. For the most up to date listing of my current projects please check out my business website
