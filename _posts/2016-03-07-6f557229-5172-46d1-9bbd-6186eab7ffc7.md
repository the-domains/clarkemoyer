### **Education Supporter**

I started late into education. When getting out of the Army I did not think that I 'needed' a college education. Times have changed for me. I have now invested in myself through both technical certifications and formal education.

I currently hold over 10 certifications and trainings. For more information regarding my DoD and industry IT certification please visit my

**[resume][0]**.

For formal education I hold a BS-IT and an MBA-ITM from WGU as well as a graduate certificate of project management from UMUC.

I highly recommend WGU to anyone seeking to further their education. For more information please see my

**[WGU alumni referral page][1]**.
